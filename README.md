# someip-sd-sim

A local SOME/IP Service Discovery (SD) demo: an independent server process
and client process, both built on [pysomeip](https://github.com/afflux/pysomeip)
(`someip` on PyPI), negotiating a real AUTOSAR SD handshake over IPv6
loopback and logging every step. This is a rehearsal for the C++
`nanom_someip_sd` sensor simulator (planned in
[nanom](https://github.com/yoavbendor/nanom)), not the simulator itself.

[![CI](https://github.com/yoavbendor/someip-sd-sim/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/yoavbendor/someip-sd-sim/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

## Real network configuration this demo models

Service IDs, eventgroup IDs, multicast addresses/ports and two real-sensor
quirks below come from a vSomeIP-based LRR sensor simulator / QNX ECU
integration doc. The SD multicast address (`ff14::4:0`) independently
matches what the tshark reverse-engineering pass found in a live capture,
which is good corroboration that these are the real, deployed values.

| Role | Address | Port | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sensor simulator (server) | `fd53:7cb8:383:2::56` | 42810 | source port for all its data |
| ECU (client) | `fd53:7cb8:383:2::1:117` | 42809 | destination for all sensor data |
| SD multicast | `ff14::4:0` | 30490 | Service Discovery announcements |
| Measurements multicast | `ff14::4:5` | 42809 | service 0x60d4, eventgroup 0x8002 |
| Status multicast | `ff14::4:3` | 42809 | service 0x60d6, eventgroup 0x8001 |

Two services are offered, each with its own eventgroup and its own
dedicated multicast group (`common.py`'s `SERVICES`):

- **Measurements** (`0x60d4` / eventgroup `0x8002`): the real notification
  is 1444+ variable bytes and SOME/IP-TP segmented, sent roughly every
  65ms. pysomeip has no TP support, so this demo uses a small fixed-size
  synthetic payload instead -- TP segmentation is a C++-port concern (see
  the project plan).
- **Status** (`0x60d6` / eventgroup `0x8001`): a fixed 116-byte
  notification sent ~30ms after each Measurements notification, using a
  **static session ID of `0x0000`** on every message (the real sensor does
  this; a stock vSomeIP increments it, requiring a patch -- see below).
  This demo replicates the static session ID directly, since it's just a
  field value, not a structural limitation.

Both services' notifications are real `someip.header.SOMEIPHeader`-framed
messages (service_id/method_id/session_id/message_type=NOTIFICATION), not
raw bytes -- so the client's log shows the actual on-wire session ID,
making the Status quirk directly visible in the transcript.

**Not yet confirmed:** the two events' own method/event IDs. The source
doc gives service and eventgroup IDs, not method IDs; `common.py` marks
its `event_id` values as placeholders (`# TODO`) until the tshark/ARXML
work turns up the real ones.

## Why the six vSomeIP patches don't need replicating here

The source doc also describes six patches applied to vSomeIP 3.5.9 to get
its own C++ sensor simulator working. Most are specific to vSomeIP's own
implementation, not to the AUTOSAR protocol, so this pysomeip-based demo
doesn't need them:

- **Multi-IP SD / routing / endpoints** (patches 1-3): needed because
  vSomeIP defaults to sending all SD from one global source IP even when
  services are configured on different IPs. The real sensor simulator box
  only uses one IP (`::56`) for all its services, so this doesn't apply
  here (or to it, really -- the patch was about vSomeIP's own
  architecture assuming one-IP-per-process in a place this deployment
  didn't want that).
- **Session ID override** (patch 5) and **reboot detection** (part of
  patch 1): the session ID quirk is replicated directly above; reboot
  detection isn't exercised by this demo (both processes start once, no
  restart-mid-run scenario).
- **IPv6 multicast fix** (patch 4) -- `if_nametoindex(device)` instead of
  `scope_id()` for choosing the multicast join interface -- **is** a real,
  protocol-adjacent networking concern (getting multicast to join on the
  correct VLAN interface rather than whatever `scope_id()` happens to
  return for a global address), just not one that affects this loopback
  demo. `common.py`'s socket helpers already join/send via an explicit
  `if_nametoindex(interface)` for the same reason. This is worth carrying
  forward as a known requirement for the C++ `nanom_someip_sd` port.

## Running it

Linux's `lo` interface gets no IPv6 multicast route (`ff00::/8`) by
default, so any multicast `sendto()` over loopback fails with
`ENETUNREACH` until you add one (real network interfaces don't need
this -- it's loopback-testing-only, and it's what CI does too):

```sh
sudo ip -6 route add ff00::/8 dev lo
```

```sh
uv sync
uv run sd-server        # terminal 1
uv run sd-client         # terminal 2
```

Expected log sequence: server's Initial-Wait delay, its first `Offer` for
each service, repetition-phase offers, the client's `Find` (or immediate
discovery if it starts after the first Offer), `Subscribe`/`SubscribeAck`
for each eventgroup logged on both sides, then Measurements and Status
notifications arriving at the client roughly every 65ms (Status ~30ms
after Measurements). Stop either process with Ctrl+C; the server logs its
`StopOffer`s and the client logs its unsubscribes.

### Running it on WSL2 (confirmed working, `--peer-addr` required)

**Confirmed end-to-end on a WSL2 Ubuntu host running as root:** a real
IPv6 kernel is present there (unlike some bare-metal dev hosts -- see the
Docker section's prerequisite check below), so the plain `uv run` path
above works with one change: WSL2's virtualized network stack, like
GitHub-hosted CI runners, does **not** deliver loopback IPv6 multicast
between two separate processes (confirmed by running both roles at
`--log-level DEBUG` for 20s+ with zero SD traffic received on either
side, despite both processes being alive and sending). This is the exact
same limitation the CI job already works around -- see the CI section
below -- so the fix is the same: add `--peer-addr` to run SD unicast,
point-to-point, instead of the default multicast:

```sh
cd ~/someip-sd-sim
git pull
uv sync

# no sudo needed if you're already root; harmless if the route exists already
ip -6 route add ff00::/8 dev lo

uv run sd-server --peer-addr ::1 --log-level DEBUG > /tmp/sd-server.log 2>&1 &
SERVER_PID=$!
sleep 2
uv run sd-client --peer-addr ::1 --log-level DEBUG > /tmp/sd-client.log 2>&1 &
CLIENT_PID=$!

sleep 45   # give the Subscribe/SubscribeAck cycle time to settle, like CI does
kill $SERVER_PID $CLIENT_PID
grep -E "Subscribe|Offer|Find|sent notification" /tmp/sd-*.log
```

This has been run and confirmed on WSL2: real `FindService`/`OfferService`
exchange with the real vendor service/eventgroup IDs and multicast
options, `Subscribe`/`SubscribeAck` for both eventgroups, and Status/
Measurements notifications streaming afterward (including the real
static-session-id-`0x0000` quirk on Status) -- the full SD negotiation,
end to end, no containers involved. No `--unicast-port` split is needed
here since both roles use their own real default ports against `::1`;
`--peer-addr` alone is what routes around the multicast gap.

If you don't have a working IPv6 kernel or aren't running as root on your
WSL2 (or other) host, fall back to the rootless-Docker/Podman path below
instead -- but note its own caveat: Podman 4.2.1's CNI backend has a
separate, unrelated IPv6-assignment bug documented in that section.

## Why two different SD unicast ports (`--unicast-port`)

Two real hosts each have their own IP address, so both can bind their SD
socket to the same well-known port (UDP/30490) without conflict. Running
both roles as two processes on **one** loopback address doesn't have that
luxury: if both bound a unicast socket to `(::1, 30490)`, the kernel's
`SO_REUSEPORT` load-balancing would deliver packets to whichever of the
two sockets it hashes to -- not necessarily the right one -- since every
packet in this demo happens to hash to the same 4-tuple. `common.py`
sidesteps this by giving the server and client independent unicast SD
ports (30490 / 30491) while keeping the multicast leg on the shared SD
port 30490, which every participant must use to see each other's
Offers/Finds. This is a loopback-demo-only wrinkle; against real hosts
each side just uses 30490.

If you'd rather demo it with genuinely separate addresses (closer to how
the real sensor/ECU pair looks), add a second loopback address instead
and drop `--unicast-port`:

```sh
sudo ip -6 addr add fd00::1/128 dev lo   # server identity
sudo ip -6 addr add fd00::2/128 dev lo   # client identity
uv run sd-server --local-addr fd00::1 --unicast-port 30490
uv run sd-client --local-addr fd00::2 --unicast-port 30490
```

(Requires `CAP_NET_ADMIN`; not available in every sandboxed environment.)

### Pointing this demo at the real network

Once the real VLAN is reachable, run each role bound to its real address
on the real interface (see `REAL_SENSOR_ADDR`/`REAL_ECU_ADDR` in
`common.py`) via `--interface`, e.g. `enp1s0f1.2` per the doc:

```sh
uv run sd-server --local-addr fd53:7cb8:383:2::56    --unicast-port 30490 --interface enp1s0f1.2
uv run sd-client --local-addr fd53:7cb8:383:2::1:117 --unicast-port 30490 --interface enp1s0f1.2
```

## Running it under rootless Docker (no sudo required)

**Prerequisite, check this first (5 seconds, no sudo):** the host kernel
itself needs IPv6 support, independent of Docker/rootless entirely --
nothing here (or anywhere else in this demo) can create an `AF_INET6`
socket without it, in a container or otherwise. Confirmed missing on at
least one real site so far, and the failure mode is specific enough to
recognize immediately:

```sh
python3 -c "import socket; socket.socket(socket.AF_INET6, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)"
# OSError: [Errno 97] Address family not supported by protocol
cat /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/all/disable_ipv6   # "No such file or directory"
ip -6 addr show                                 # prints nothing, not even ::1
```

That combination means the `ipv6` kernel module isn't loaded on the host
at all (not a sysctl toggle, not a rootless-netns quirk -- the whole IPv6
stack is absent from the running kernel), which needs `modprobe ipv6` --
root, so not fixable from a rootless setup. If you hit this: ask your
site admin to enable IPv6 on the host, or find a different host that has
it (a colleague's machine, a VM, or eventually the real target VLAN,
which almost certainly already has IPv6 since that's what the actual
AUTOSAR system runs on). In the meantime, `scripts/offline_roundtrip_check.py`
needs no networking at all, and CI is your live, verified proof of the
networked behavior -- both the loopback and Docker-bridge-multicast jobs
are green (see the CI section below).

If your dev host doesn't give you `sudo` for `ip -6 addr add`/`ip -6 route
add` (both used above for loopback testing), running the two roles as
separate **containers on their own Docker bridge network** sidesteps that
entirely: each container gets its own real IPv6 address, so none of the
loopback-sharing workarounds (`--unicast-port`, the multicast route, extra
addresses on `lo`) are needed -- both roles run at their real addresses
(`fd53:7cb8:383:2::56` / `::1:117`) with plain `--unicast-port 30490` on
both, exactly as a real deployment would.

```sh
module load docker-rootless   # however your site activates it; check `module avail docker-rootless`
```

**Which tooling you have varies by site** -- some rootless Docker installs
ship the `docker compose` CLI plugin, some ship the older standalone
`docker-compose` binary instead, and some (e.g. a bare `docker` from a
module with no plugins layered on) ship neither. Check once:

```sh
docker compose version    # CLI plugin?
which docker-compose      # standalone binary?
```

**If either exists**, use `docker-compose.yml` in this repo (same commands
either way -- swap `docker compose` for `docker-compose` if that's what you
have):

```sh
docker compose build
docker compose --profile smoketest up --abort-on-container-exit --exit-code-from mcast-recv   # validate first, see below
docker compose up --build       # then the real demo
docker compose down             # stop
```

**If neither exists** (confirmed the case on at least one real site so
far: `docker` with no `compose` subcommand and no standalone binary),
`scripts/docker_run_demo.sh` and friends do the exact same thing with
plain `docker build`/`network create`/`run` -- no compose needed at all:

```sh
scripts/docker_smoke_test.sh    # validate first, see below
scripts/docker_run_demo.sh      # then the real demo
docker logs -f sd-server        # tail either container's log
docker logs -f sd-client
scripts/docker_stop_demo.sh     # stop and clean up
```

**Validate the environment first** (30 seconds, no sudo, no image beyond
what you just built): confirms this Docker setup actually delivers IPv6
multicast between containers on the bridge, using the same standalone
probe script (`scripts/mcast_smoke_test.py`) either path runs. CI's own
Docker job (`docker-compose-multicast` in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
confirmed this works end-to-end on GitHub-hosted runners -- a genuinely
different result from bare loopback multicast on the same runners, which
doesn't work at all (see the CI section below): a Docker bridge is a real
L2 device between two containers, whose traffic never leaves the VM's own
kernel netns, unlike loopback's special-cased handling. That's real (if
rootful) evidence the underlying mechanism works; the smoke test confirms
it also holds for your specific rootless setup. Exits 0 if the multicast
packet was received, 1 if not.

Expected log sequence, either path, is the same as the plain `uv run` case
above, just prefixed with each container's name.

**If the smoke test fails** (some rootless Docker network backends restrict
multicast more than others): fall back to the CI-only unicast mode --
add `--peer-addr fd53:7cb8:383:2::1:117` to the server command and
`--peer-addr fd53:7cb8:383:2::56` to the client command (in
`docker-compose.yml`, or in `docker_run_demo.sh` if you're on the
plain-`docker` path). Since each container already has its own real
address (unlike the loopback case CI runs in), this needs none of the
port-splitting either -- `create_unicast_sd_endpoint` in `common.py` still
exercises the full real SD negotiation and timing state machine, just
point-to-point instead of via multicast.

**Why this should work in rootless mode, and what's actually confirmed:**
container-to-container traffic on a shared Docker bridge network is
ordinary Linux bridging inside the daemon's own network namespace --
unlike loopback multicast on a virtualized CI runner, and unlike the
host<->container path, it doesn't go through slirp4netns/pasta (those only
mediate the bridge's uplink to the outside world). CI has since confirmed
this reasoning holds in practice, not just in theory: GitHub Actions'
`docker-compose-multicast` job runs this exact `docker-compose.yml` in its
default (multicast) mode on a fresh `ubuntu-latest` runner and it passes --
hundreds of real notifications exchanged, genuine multicast SD traffic
logged -- on the very same class of runner where bare loopback multicast
does not work at all. That's rootful Docker, though, not rootless: I
couldn't verify the rootless case myself (this session's own sandbox
kernel has no IPv6 support whatsoever -- confirmed independently several
times, including Docker's own `--ipv6` bridge creation failing here the
same way -- so nothing IPv6 was testable here regardless of Docker/rootless
specifics). The smoke test above is the fast way to get a real answer for
rootless specifically on your host; please let me know what it reports so
this section can be corrected if rootless Docker's multicast support turns
out to be more restricted than rootful.

### Podman instead of Docker

`scripts/docker_run_demo.sh`, `docker_smoke_test.sh` and
`docker_stop_demo.sh` all work with Podman too -- set `CONTAINER_ENGINE=podman`
(they default to `docker`; Podman's CLI is close enough to Docker's that
the exact same `build`/`network create`/`run`/`wait`/`logs` calls apply):

```sh
module load podman/<version>   # however your site activates it
export CONTAINER_ENGINE=podman
scripts/docker_smoke_test.sh    # validate first
scripts/docker_run_demo.sh      # then the real demo
podman logs -f sd-server
podman logs -f sd-client
scripts/docker_stop_demo.sh     # stop and clean up
```

If your site's Podman ships `podman-compose` or a `podman compose`
subcommand, `docker-compose.yml` works there too (same commands as the
Docker case, swap `docker compose`/`docker-compose` for `podman
compose`/`podman-compose`).

Podman doesn't change anything about the IPv6 prerequisite above:
containers share the host kernel's network stack directly regardless of
which engine manages them, so if `AF_INET6` socket creation fails on the
host, it fails identically under Podman -- this isn't a Docker-specific
gap. Podman is, if anything, slightly better suited to the no-sudo
constraint (it's rootless by design, not rootless-as-a-mode-on-top-of-a
normally-rootful-daemon like Docker), so once the host kernel has IPv6,
it's a reasonable first thing to try.

**Confirmed broken on Podman 4.2.1's CNI network backend specifically:**
IPv6 static address assignment (`--network NET:ip6=ADDR`) silently does
nothing on this Podman version -- the container's `eth0` only ever gets
the kernel's automatic link-local address (`fe80::...`), never the
requested global address, which then makes any `sendto()` to a
global/ULA-scoped destination fail with `OSError: [Errno 99] Cannot
assign requested address` (`EADDRNOTAVAIL`), since the interface has no
source address in that scope at all. Confirmed directly:

```sh
podman run --rm --network "someip-sd-net:ip6=fd53:7cb8:383:2::99" \
  --entrypoint cat someip-sd-sim /proc/net/if_inet6
# only fe80:: (eth0) and ::1 (lo) -- the requested ::99 never shows up
```

This lines up with the recurring `plugin firewall does not support
config version "1.0.0"` warning Podman 4.2.1 prints on every network
command -- its bundled CNI plugin config is generating a config version
its installed CNI plugin binaries don't understand, and it's plausible
that's breaking more than just the named `firewall` plugin (the IPAM
plugin included). This is a Podman/CNI installation issue, not something
`docker_run_demo.sh`/`docker_smoke_test.sh` can work around by changing
flags -- the network namespace genuinely has no usable address. Fixing
it for real needs either a newer Podman (the `netavark` backend replaces
CNI and doesn't have this bug) or matching/upgrading the host's
`containernetworking-plugins` package to what Podman 4.2.1 expects.

If you're already running as root and the host kernel has IPv6 (check
the prerequisite above) -- e.g. exactly this WSL2-as-root case -- skip
containers entirely and use the plain `uv run` path from "Running it"
above instead: it needs neither Docker's IPv6-bridge support nor
Podman's CNI networking, and is already the most-verified path (proven
locally and in CI).

## CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on every push/PR:

1. **Offline SD wire round-trip check** (`scripts/offline_roundtrip_check.py`)
   -- builds the same OfferService/Subscribe entries and data notifications
   the demo builds and confirms they round-trip through pysomeip's own SD
   serialize/parse. No networking, runs anywhere.
2. **A live run of `sd-server`/`sd-client`** as real background processes,
   over real IPv6 sockets on the runner's loopback -- but **unicast**, via
   `--peer-addr ::1` on both, not the demo's default multicast. GitHub-hosted
   `ubuntu-latest` runners were found, empirically, not to deliver IPv6
   multicast traffic on `lo` between processes **at all** -- confirmed with
   a raw, pysomeip-independent socket test (`scripts/mcast_smoke_test.py`,
   still run as a non-blocking diagnostic in CI): join succeeds, send
   succeeds, receive times out with zero packets, even with the multicast
   route added and `IPV6_MULTICAST_LOOP` explicitly enabled. That's a
   runner/hypervisor networking limitation, not something fixable from
   inside the VM. `--peer-addr` (see `create_unicast_sd_endpoint` in
   `common.py`) sidesteps it entirely: `ServiceDiscoveryProtocol`'s
   `default_addr` is pointed at the known peer instead of a multicast
   group, so every send that would otherwise go to the multicast group goes
   directly to that peer -- still 100% real sockets/asyncio/pysomeip SD
   code and the real timing state machine, just not real multicast fan-out.
   The demo's default (no `--peer-addr`) behavior is untouched and stays
   multicast-based, matching the real vendor deployment, for local or
   self-hosted-runner use where multicast actually works.
3. Both logs are grepped for the expected sequence -- `Offer`, `Subscribe`,
   `SubscribeAck`, and at least one received notification for each of
   Measurements and Status. The job fails (and uploads all logs as
   artifacts) if any expected line is missing within the timeout.

A second job, `docker-compose-multicast`, answers a different question:
does a **Docker bridge** fare better than bare loopback for multicast on
the same class of runner? It builds `docker-compose.yml`, runs the smoke
test between two throwaway containers, then runs the real demo in its
**default multicast mode** (no `--peer-addr`) and checks the same
sequence. Yes, it does: this job passes, with real multicast SD traffic
and hundreds of notifications exchanged between the two containers --
good evidence for the reasoning in the Docker section above.
`continue-on-error` at the job level, so it's informational and can never
block the primary (already green) job.

## Verifying against nanom_shark's own SOME/IP-SD decoder

For an independent sanity check that the wire bytes this demo produces are
actually spec-correct SOME/IP-SD, capture the loopback traffic and decode
it with [nanom_shark's](https://github.com/yoavbendor/nanom) decoder
(clone that repo separately -- it's not a dependency of this one):

```sh
tcpdump -i lo -w /tmp/sd_demo.pcap 'udp port 30490 or udp port 42809' &
# run the demo for a few seconds, then stop tcpdump
git clone https://github.com/yoavbendor/nanom /tmp/nanom
cmake -B /tmp/nanom/build -S /tmp/nanom && cmake --build /tmp/nanom/build --target nanom_shark_cli -j
/tmp/nanom/build/nanom_shark_cli /tmp/sd_demo.pcap --json /tmp/sd_demo.ndjson
```

## Handing off to a tcpreplay of real captured sensor data

If the goal is to simulate the real sensor by tcpreplaying its actual
captured multicast traffic (rather than this demo's synthetic
notifications), `sd-server --exit-after-subscribed` does the real SD
handshake (Offer/Subscribe/Ack, via pysomeip, exactly as normal) and then
exits 0 the moment every offered service has a subscriber, instead of
entering the notification loop:

```sh
uv run sd-server --exit-after-subscribed && \
  tcpreplay -i eth0 captured_sensor_data.pcap
```

Why this is safe to hand off to tcpreplay: once the client's real
SubscribeAck has been received, its multicast group membership is tracked
by its own socket/OS (IGMP/MLD join) -- independent of whether the server
process that sent the Ack is still running. So the server can simply
disappear, and the client keeps listening on the same multicast group(s)
it already joined, ready to receive tcpreplay's traffic as if the real
server had sent it.

Two things this flag does to make that safe:

- **Sets the offered-service TTL to "forever"** (`someip.sd.TTL_FOREVER`),
  so the client never needs another Offer to keep considering the service
  valid.
- **Exits via `os._exit()`, without sending StopOffer.** This is a
  deliberate implementation detail, not an oversight: pysomeip sends a
  StopOffer whenever a service's offer task is cancelled (see
  `ServiceInstance` in `someip/sd.py`) -- including via the normal
  `sd_prot.stop()` shutdown path, and including via `asyncio.run()`'s own
  default "cancel every remaining task" cleanup on the way out. Either of
  those would tell the client the service is gone right before handing off
  to tcpreplay, defeating the whole point. `os._exit()` terminates the
  process immediately, skipping all of that -- the same way a real sensor
  that lost power would vanish without a StopOffer, which is exactly the
  behavior wanted here.

**Caveat -- the eventgroup *subscribe* TTL is the client's choice, not
this server's.** The offered-service TTL above is entirely under this
server's control, but the per-eventgroup Subscribe TTL is chosen by the
*client* in its own Subscribe request; pysomeip's server-side Ack just
echoes back whatever TTL the client asked for (see `handle_subscribe()` in
`someip/sd.py`). If your target client requests a short subscribe TTL and
expects to periodically renew it, it will find nobody answering once this
process has exited. Whether that actually makes the client drop its
subscription state or leave the multicast group is entirely up to that
client's own implementation -- some stacks keep listening regardless,
others may not. **Verify this empirically against your real target
client** before relying on a long tcpreplay run; if it turns out to
matter, the practical fix is on the client/network side (e.g. keep
tcpreplay's run shorter than the client's subscribe TTL), not something
this server can override on its own.

`scripts/exit_after_subscribed_check.py` covers the wait-for-subscribers
logic offline (no networking); `ci.yml`'s "exit-after-subscribed" step
covers the live exit-0/no-StopOffer behavior end-to-end.

## Relationship to the C++ port

This demo is deliberately throwaway/reference code: once the two
placeholder event IDs are confirmed (from the tshark/ARXML
reverse-engineering work against the actual vendor MCU), this Python
server becomes the initial simulator's SD negotiator for real integration
testing. Only after that does the C++ rewrite (`nanom_someip_sd`, a
sibling repo to this one) begin -- carrying forward the multicast-join-
interface lesson from the vSomeIP patches above, and adding real
SOME/IP-TP segmentation support for the Measurements payload, neither of
which this Python demo needed to implement.
