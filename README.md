# someip-sd-sim

A local SOME/IP Service Discovery (SD) demo: an independent server process
and client process, both built on [pysomeip](https://github.com/afflux/pysomeip)
(`someip` on PyPI), negotiating a real AUTOSAR SD handshake over IPv6
loopback and logging every step. This is a rehearsal for the C++
`nanom_someip_sd` sensor simulator (planned in
[nanom](https://github.com/yoavbendor/nanom)), not the simulator itself.

## Real network configuration this demo models

Service IDs, eventgroup IDs, multicast addresses/ports and two real-sensor
quirks below come from a vSomeIP-based LRR sensor simulator / QNX ECU
integration doc. The SD multicast address (`ff14::4:0`) independently
matches what the tshark reverse-engineering pass found in a live capture,
which is good corroboration that these are the real, deployed values.

| Role | Address | Port | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sensor simulator (server) | `fd53:7cb8:383:2::56` | 42810 | source port for all its data |
| ECU (client) | `fd53:7cb8:383:2::1:117` | 42809 | destination for all sensor data |
| SD multicast | `ff14::4:0` | 30490 | Service Discovery announcements |
| Measurements multicast | `ff14::4:5` | 42809 | service 0x60d4, eventgroup 0x8002 |
| Status multicast | `ff14::4:3` | 42809 | service 0x60d6, eventgroup 0x8001 |

Two services are offered, each with its own eventgroup and its own
dedicated multicast group (`common.py`'s `SERVICES`):

- **Measurements** (`0x60d4` / eventgroup `0x8002`): the real notification
  is 1444+ variable bytes and SOME/IP-TP segmented, sent roughly every
  65ms. pysomeip has no TP support, so this demo uses a small fixed-size
  synthetic payload instead -- TP segmentation is a C++-port concern (see
  the project plan).
- **Status** (`0x60d6` / eventgroup `0x8001`): a fixed 116-byte
  notification sent ~30ms after each Measurements notification, using a
  **static session ID of `0x0000`** on every message (the real sensor does
  this; a stock vSomeIP increments it, requiring a patch -- see below).
  This demo replicates the static session ID directly, since it's just a
  field value, not a structural limitation.

Both services' notifications are real `someip.header.SOMEIPHeader`-framed
messages (service_id/method_id/session_id/message_type=NOTIFICATION), not
raw bytes -- so the client's log shows the actual on-wire session ID,
making the Status quirk directly visible in the transcript.

**Not yet confirmed:** the two events' own method/event IDs. The source
doc gives service and eventgroup IDs, not method IDs; `common.py` marks
its `event_id` values as placeholders (`# TODO`) until the tshark/ARXML
work turns up the real ones.

## Why the six vSomeIP patches don't need replicating here

The source doc also describes six patches applied to vSomeIP 3.5.9 to get
its own C++ sensor simulator working. Most are specific to vSomeIP's own
implementation, not to the AUTOSAR protocol, so this pysomeip-based demo
doesn't need them:

- **Multi-IP SD / routing / endpoints** (patches 1-3): needed because
  vSomeIP defaults to sending all SD from one global source IP even when
  services are configured on different IPs. The real sensor simulator box
  only uses one IP (`::56`) for all its services, so this doesn't apply
  here (or to it, really -- the patch was about vSomeIP's own
  architecture assuming one-IP-per-process in a place this deployment
  didn't want that).
- **Session ID override** (patch 5) and **reboot detection** (part of
  patch 1): the session ID quirk is replicated directly above; reboot
  detection isn't exercised by this demo (both processes start once, no
  restart-mid-run scenario).
- **IPv6 multicast fix** (patch 4) -- `if_nametoindex(device)` instead of
  `scope_id()` for choosing the multicast join interface -- **is** a real,
  protocol-adjacent networking concern (getting multicast to join on the
  correct VLAN interface rather than whatever `scope_id()` happens to
  return for a global address), just not one that affects this loopback
  demo. `common.py`'s socket helpers already join/send via an explicit
  `if_nametoindex(interface)` for the same reason. This is worth carrying
  forward as a known requirement for the C++ `nanom_someip_sd` port.

## Running it

```sh
uv sync
uv run sd-server        # terminal 1
uv run sd-client         # terminal 2
```

Expected log sequence: server's Initial-Wait delay, its first `Offer` for
each service, repetition-phase offers, the client's `Find` (or immediate
discovery if it starts after the first Offer), `Subscribe`/`SubscribeAck`
for each eventgroup logged on both sides, then Measurements and Status
notifications arriving at the client roughly every 65ms (Status ~30ms
after Measurements). Stop either process with Ctrl+C; the server logs its
`StopOffer`s and the client logs its unsubscribes.

## Why two different SD unicast ports (`--unicast-port`)

Two real hosts each have their own IP address, so both can bind their SD
socket to the same well-known port (UDP/30490) without conflict. Running
both roles as two processes on **one** loopback address doesn't have that
luxury: if both bound a unicast socket to `(::1, 30490)`, the kernel's
`SO_REUSEPORT` load-balancing would deliver packets to whichever of the
two sockets it hashes to -- not necessarily the right one -- since every
packet in this demo happens to hash to the same 4-tuple. `common.py`
sidesteps this by giving the server and client independent unicast SD
ports (30490 / 30491) while keeping the multicast leg on the shared SD
port 30490, which every participant must use to see each other's
Offers/Finds. This is a loopback-demo-only wrinkle; against real hosts
each side just uses 30490.

If you'd rather demo it with genuinely separate addresses (closer to how
the real sensor/ECU pair looks), add a second loopback address instead
and drop `--unicast-port`:

```sh
sudo ip -6 addr add fd00::1/128 dev lo   # server identity
sudo ip -6 addr add fd00::2/128 dev lo   # client identity
uv run sd-server --local-addr fd00::1 --unicast-port 30490
uv run sd-client --local-addr fd00::2 --unicast-port 30490
```

(Requires `CAP_NET_ADMIN`; not available in every sandboxed environment.)

### Pointing this demo at the real network

Once the real VLAN is reachable, run each role bound to its real address
on the real interface (see `REAL_SENSOR_ADDR`/`REAL_ECU_ADDR` in
`common.py`), with `INTERFACE` in `common.py` changed from `"lo"` to the
real interface (`enp1s0f1.2` per the doc):

```sh
uv run sd-server --local-addr fd53:7cb8:383:2::56   --unicast-port 30490
uv run sd-client --local-addr fd53:7cb8:383:2::1:117 --unicast-port 30490
```

## CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs this end-to-end on every push/PR: it
installs `uv`, syncs the project, starts `sd-server` and `sd-client` as
real background processes talking over the runner's actual IPv6 loopback
(GitHub's `ubuntu-latest` runners have working IPv6, unlike some sandboxed
dev environments), and greps both logs for the expected sequence --
`Offer`, `Subscribe`, `SubscribeAck`, and at least one received
notification for each of Measurements and Status. The job fails (and
uploads both full logs as artifacts) if any expected line is missing
within the timeout.

## Verifying against nanom_shark's own SOME/IP-SD decoder

For an independent sanity check that the wire bytes this demo produces are
actually spec-correct SOME/IP-SD, capture the loopback traffic and decode
it with [nanom_shark's](https://github.com/yoavbendor/nanom) decoder
(clone that repo separately -- it's not a dependency of this one):

```sh
tcpdump -i lo -w /tmp/sd_demo.pcap 'udp port 30490 or udp port 42809' &
# run the demo for a few seconds, then stop tcpdump
git clone https://github.com/yoavbendor/nanom /tmp/nanom
cmake -B /tmp/nanom/build -S /tmp/nanom && cmake --build /tmp/nanom/build --target nanom_shark_cli -j
/tmp/nanom/build/nanom_shark_cli /tmp/sd_demo.pcap --json /tmp/sd_demo.ndjson
```

## Relationship to the C++ port

This demo is deliberately throwaway/reference code: once the two
placeholder event IDs are confirmed (from the tshark/ARXML
reverse-engineering work against the actual vendor MCU), this Python
server becomes the initial simulator's SD negotiator for real integration
testing. Only after that does the C++ rewrite (`nanom_someip_sd`, a
sibling repo to this one) begin -- carrying forward the multicast-join-
interface lesson from the vSomeIP patches above, and adding real
SOME/IP-TP segmentation support for the Measurements payload, neither of
which this Python demo needed to implement.
